# ITI1121-Assignment1
The first assignment for ITI1121

This assignment was a guide on how to implement a gradient decent algorithm in Java. Starting off with just 1 variable and then
generalizing that method for n number of variables.

Includes the generated Javadoc files, that's why it's mostly HTML
